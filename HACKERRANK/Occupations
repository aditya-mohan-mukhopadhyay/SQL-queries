OCCUPATIONS

Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.
Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.
Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

--Solution

SELECT MIN(IF(Occupation = 'Doctor',Name,NULL)),MIN(IF(Occupation = 'Professor',Name,NULL)),MIN(IF(Occupation = 'Singer',Name,NULL)),MIN(IF(Occupation = 'Actor',Name,NULL)) 
FROM(SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Occupation
                             ORDER BY Name) AS row_num,Name, Occupation
    FROM OCCUPATIONS) AS ord
GROUP BY row_num;
