Active User Retention [Facebook SQL Interview Question] [Hard Difficulty]

Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, 
including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".

Hint:

An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.

user_actions Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
event_id	integer
event_type	string ("sign-in, "like", "comment")
event_date	datetime

user_actionsExample Input:
user_id	event_id	event_type	event_date
445	7765	sign-in	05/31/2022 12:00:00
742	6458	sign-in	06/03/2022 12:00:00
445	3634	like	06/05/2022 12:00:00
742	1374	comment	06/05/2022 12:00:00
648	3124	like	06/18/2022 12:00:00


--Solution

Select EXTRACT(month from event_date) As month_name,COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) as monthly_active_users from user_actions
where EXTRACT(month from event_date) = 7 and user_id IN(Select DISTINCT(user_id) From user_actions 
Where EXTRACT(month from event_date) = 6)
GROUP BY EXTRACT(month from event_date);
