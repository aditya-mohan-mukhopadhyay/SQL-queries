| Column Name  | Type    |

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, 
rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two 
consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

WITH CTE AS (
SELECT
player_id, min(event_date) as event_start_date
from
Activity
group by player_id )

SELECT
round((count(distinct c.player_id) / (select count(distinct player_id) from activity)),2)as fraction
FROM
CTE c
JOIN Activity a
on c.player_id = a.player_id
and datediff(c.event_start_date, a.event_date) = -1;
