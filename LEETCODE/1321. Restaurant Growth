You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).
Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.
Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

-- Solution
select a.visited_on, 
    sum(b.amount) amount,
    round(sum(b.amount)/7,2) average_amount
from (select visited_on, sum(amount) amount from Customer GROUP BY visited_on) a, 
    (select visited_on, sum(amount) amount from Customer GROUP BY visited_on) b 
where datediff(a.visited_on,b.visited_on) between 0 and 6
group by a.visited_on
having count(distinct b.visited_on) = 7;
